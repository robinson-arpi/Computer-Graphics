# Tetrahedron 3D Rendering

This Python script uses Pygame and OpenGL to render a 3D tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is drawn and displayed in a window, and you can customize its size, colors, and rotation.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python, Pygame, and PyOpenGL installed.
2. Run the `sierpinski_gasket3D.py` script.
3. Observe the 3D tetrahedron rotating in the window.

## Customization

- You can adjust the size of the tetrahedron by changing the `scale_factor` variable.
- Modify the `colors` list to change the colors of the tetrahedron's faces.
- The `glRotatef` function controls the rotation of the tetrahedron. You can modify its parameters to change the rotation axis and speed.

Feel free to experiment and customize the script to create your own 3D graphics.
